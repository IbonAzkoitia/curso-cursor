# Modern Web Development Guidelines

This rule applies to: *.html, *.css, *.js, *.jsx, *.ts, *.tsx

## Overview
General guidelines for modern web development using HTML5, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript.

## Key Principles
- Write semantic, accessible HTML5 code
- Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling, focusing on utility-first approach
- Write clean, modern JavaScript following ES6+ standards
- Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes
- Optimize for performance and page load speed

## Project Structure
- Maintain separation of concerns (HTML for structure, CSS for presentation, JS for behavior)
- Follow the established directory structure with src/ for source files and dist/ for compiled output
- Use proper file naming conventions (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)

## Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for images and heavy content
- Minimize HTTP requests by combining files where appropriate
- Optimize images and media files
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP where supported)
